    /*Write a function solution that, given two integers A and B, returns a string containing exactly A letters 'a' and exactly B letters 'b' with no three consecutive letters being the same (in other words, neither "aaa" nor "bbb" may occur in the returned string).

Examples:

1. Given A = 5 and B = 3, your function may return "aabaabab". Note that "abaabbaa" would also be a correct answer. Your function may return any correct answer.

2. Given A = 3 and B = 3, your function should return "ababab", "aababb", "abaabb" or any of several other strings.

3. Given A = 1 and B = 4, your function should return "bbabb", which is the only correct answer in this case.

Assume that:

A and B are integers within the range [0..100];
at least one solution exists for the given A and B.
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
